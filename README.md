CAN Data Collection
This repository contains code for collecting data from a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The system is designed for applications such as vehicle diagnostics, fleet monitoring, and telematics. The collected data can be used for analytics, performance monitoring, and real-time diagnostics.

This project provides code to gather data from a vehicle's CAN bus, which is commonly used for in-vehicle networking. It enables the collection of data such as engine metrics, diagnostics, and sensor values from the CAN bus for further analysis. This setup is particularly valuable for vehicle monitoring, performance tracking, and creating custom logging systems.

Features
CAN Data Acquisition: Collects real-time data from the CAN bus.
Logging Capability: Stores CAN data for analysis and monitoring.
Error Handling: Implements basic error checking for reliable data collection.
Configurable Settings: Supports customization of CAN baud rate and data parameters.

Hardware Requirements
Microcontroller: Arduino 
CAN Module: MCP2515 or compatible CAN interface

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (version 1.8.12)
CAN Library: Required for interfacing with the CAN module
